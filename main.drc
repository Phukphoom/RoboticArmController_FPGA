WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_1/XLXI_9/XLXN_8 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_1/XLXI_9/XLXN_7 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_32/XLXI_167/XLXN_16 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_32/XLXN_423 is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_32/XLXI_167/XLXN_15 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_32/XLXI_167/XLXN_14 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXI_32/XLXI_167/XLXN_13 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net XLXN_70 is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
